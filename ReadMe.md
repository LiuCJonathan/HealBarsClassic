v1.4.3

Fixed a common cause of heal bars getting suck
Fixed regular and HoT heals not showing up at the same time
Potentially fixed issues with Party heals not showing up

Removed the Fast Health Update setting, which didn't actually work, at least in its current form.

Please continue to report any bugs so that I can fix them
